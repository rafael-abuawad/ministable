Collateral is the chain's native coin (ETH, MON on Monad, S on Sonic), priced
by the `native_usd_price_feed` named contract in moccasin.toml, which must
quote that coin in USD.
Live networks must pin its address there; only local networks deploy a mock.
Live networks also set `oracle_timeout` (the feed's heartbeat plus a buffer)
under `extra_data`, and L2s pin a `sequencer_uptime_feed`.
