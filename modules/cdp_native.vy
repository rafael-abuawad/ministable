@title CDP Engine Backed by the Native Coin
@custom:contract-name cdp_native
@notice Users lock the chain's native coin via `deposit` and
        mint the stablecoin against it at a minimum 150%
        collateral ratio. The accounting lives in the `cdp`
        module; this module receives and sends the native
        coin.
