@title CDP Engine Backed by an ERC-20 Token
@custom:contract-name cdp_erc20
@notice Users lock an ERC-20 collateral token (e.g. USDC,
        USDT, WETH) via `deposit` and mint the stablecoin
        against it at a minimum 150% collateral ratio. The
        accounting lives in the `cdp` module; this module
        pulls and sends the collateral token.

        The collateral token must have 6 to 18 decimals and
        may omit the `bool` return value on `transfer` and
        `transferFrom` (as USDT does). Deposits credit the
        balance the contract actually received, so tokens
        that charge a fee on transfer are accounted for.
        Rebasing tokens are not supported: a negative rebase
        would leave the contract holding less than it owes.
