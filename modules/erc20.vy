# @dev We export (i.e. the runtime bytecode exposes these

# the ABI encoding specification) the `external` getter
# function `owner` from the `ownable` module as well as the
# function `eip712Domain` from the `eip712_domain_separator`
# module.
# @notice Please note that you must always also export (if
# required by the contract logic) `public` declared `constant`,
# `immutable`, and state variables, for which Vyper automatically
# generates an `external` getter function for the variable.
exports: (
    # @notice This ERC-20 implementation includes the `transfer_ownership`
