@title Collateral-Agnostic CDP Engine
@custom:contract-name cdp
@notice The accounting shared by every CDP module: positions,
        debt shares, the stability fee, liquidations, bad debt,
        redemptions, the surplus and the oracle. Users mint the
        stablecoin against their collateral at a minimum 150%
        collateral ratio. Debt accrues a fixed stability fee,
        minted to the protocol's surplus. Positions below 150%
        can be liquidated back to 150%: the liquidator repays
        debt and receives 110% of it in collateral. Debt that a
        position's collateral cannot cover becomes bad debt,
        which the surplus and reserve absorb. Anyone can redeem
        the stablecoin for $1 of collateral from a healthy
        position.

        This module never moves collateral. Its internal
        functions update the accounting and return the
        collateral to pay out; the module wrapping it (e.g.
        `cdp_native`, `cdp_erc20`) receives and sends the
        collateral itself, after the accounting is done.
